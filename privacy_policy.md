**Privacy Policy for BSTP Environment Version Checker**

Thank you for using BSTP Environment Version Checker (referred to as "the Extension," "we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information, particularly your Bitbucket Personal Access Token (PAT) and the data accessed from your Bitbucket instance, when you use our browser extension.
Our core principle is to collect and store the minimum information necessary for the Extension to function and to handle that information transparently and securely.

1. Information We Collect and Why
The Extension handles the following types of information:

    - Bitbucket Personal Access Token (PAT):
    How we get it: You provide your PAT directly within the Extension's interface.
    Why we need it: The PAT is essential for the Extension to authenticate with your Bitbucket instance (e.g., a self-hosted or cloud instance like https://bitbucket.org or your company's https://bitbucket.yourcompany.com) and make API requests to fetch your project and environment version information. This is the core functionality of the Extension.
    Where it's stored: Your PAT is stored locally on your computer using the browser's secure storage mechanism (e.g., chrome.storage.local or equivalent). It is NOT transmitted to or stored on any external servers operated by us or any third party.
    
    - Bitbucket Project and Environment Data:
    How we get it: Once authenticated with your PAT, the Extension makes API calls to your specified Bitbucket instance to retrieve data such as project names, repository contents (specifically values-*.yaml files or similar, to parse image tags), and version details.
    Why we need it: This data is necessary to display the version information and image tags you requested within the Extension's interface.
    Processing: This data is fetched from your Bitbucket instance and processed locally within the Extension in your browser to extract and display the relevant version information. This project data is NOT transmitted to or stored on any external servers operated by us or any third party.
    
    - Extension Configuration/Preferences (Potentially):
    What it might be: The Extension might store your preferences, such as the last selected project or environment, locally to improve your user experience.
    Where it's stored: If such preferences are stored, they are kept locally in your browser's storage.

2. How We Use Your Information
To Provide Core Functionality: Your PAT and Bitbucket project data are used exclusively to fetch and display the version information as requested by you within the Extension.
To Improve User Experience: Locally stored preferences (if any) help the Extension remember your choices for easier use.
To Improve the Extension (If collecting anonymous usage data): Anonymous, aggregated data helps us enhance features and stability.

3. How We Store and Protect Your Information
Local Storage: Your Bitbucket PAT and any locally stored preferences are stored on your device using your browser's built-in secure storage.
PAT Security: Your PAT is only ever transmitted directly from your browser to your specified Bitbucket instance over HTTPS. We do not have access to your PAT.
Data Minimization: We only request and process the data absolutely necessary for the Extension's functionality.

4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
We DO NOT share your Bitbucket PAT or specific Bitbucket project/environment data with any third parties.
The Extension facilitates a direct connection between your browser and your Bitbucket instance.
If we were to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data, it would not contain any personally identifiable information and might be used for internal analysis or public reporting on general usage trends.

5. Your Choices and Rights
Managing Your PAT: You can remove your stored PAT at any time by [Explain how: e.g., "using the 'Logout' or 'Clear PAT' button within the Extension settings," or "by clearing the browser's storage for this extension, or by uninstalling the extension."].
Accessing Your Data: The data the Extension processes (your project/version information) is sourced from your own Bitbucket account, which you can access directly.
Uninstalling the Extension: You can uninstall the Extension at any time through your browser's extension management page. Uninstalling will remove any locally stored data, including your PAT and preferences.

6. Children's Privacy
The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the Extension interface or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
